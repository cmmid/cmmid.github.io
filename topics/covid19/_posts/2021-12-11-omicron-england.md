We model the potential consequences of the Omicron SARS-CoV-2 variant on transmission and health outcomes in England, with scenarios varying the extent of immune escape; the effectiveness, uptake and speed of COVID-19 booster vaccinations; and the reintroduction of control measures. These results suggest that Omicron has the potential to cause substantial surges in cases, hospital admissions and deaths in populations with high levels of immunity, including England. The reintroduction of additional non-pharmaceutical interventions may be required to prevent hospital admissions exceeding the levels seen in England during the previous peak in winter 2020â€“2021.

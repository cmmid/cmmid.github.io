**Read the [24th May report here.](reports/2021_05_24_importations.pdf)** Accompanying code is [available here](https://github.com/adamkucharski/covid-import-model).

Earlier versions of this analysis: [12th May report](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cmmid-covid-19-working-group-modelling-importations-and-local-transmission-of-b16172-in-the-uk-12-may-2021?utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=govuk-notifications&utm_source=44bb4abd-fb1b-42db-b903-08d94dfe0090&utm_content=immediately); [18th May report](reports/2021_05_18_importations.pdf).

Plot below shows results for 2nd June 2021. These results would suggest 40% (95% CrI: 25â€“54%) higher transmission for B.1.617.2 compared to non-B.1.617.2 variants circulating.

Figure 1: A) Reported cases in India. B) Proportion of reported sequences in India that are B.1.617.2, with black line showing moving average (constrained to end at 100%). C) Estimated imported cases of B.1.617.2 into the UK that contribute to onwards transmission (orange line, with 95% shaded CrI interval), reported traveller cases of B.1.617.2 as described in [PHE Technical Report 12](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/investigation-of-novel-sars-cov-2-variant-variant-of-concern-20201201) (black dots); simulated imported cases and onwards transmission using maximum a posteriori (MAP) model estimate (red line with 95% negative binomial CrI). D) Reported cases in the UK. Black dots show data, black line shows 7 day centred moving average; green line shows estimated non-B.1.617.2 cases with 95% CrI; red line as in (C); blue line and shaded region shows predicted total cases in UK with negative binomial 95% CrI. E) Black dots show number of non-B.1.617.2 sequences in COG-UK data up to 11th May 2021; green line shows fitted model with 95% negative binomial CrI. Grey region shows data in the past week, which is likely subject to reporting delays. F) Black dots show number of B.1.617.2 sequences in COG-UK data up to 11th May 2021; red line shows fitted model with 95% negative binomial CrI. G) Black dots show proportion of B.1.617.2 sequences in COG-UK data up to 11th May 2021; blue line shows MAP model estimate. H) Estimated change in R among non-travellers over time, assuming a step-change at some point during the observed period. Line shows median and shaded region 95% CrI; as in other panels, dashed grey line shows date B.1.617.2 was declared VOC in UK. I) Estimate of Rtraveller , Rnon-traveller and Rrecent in model, with thick line showing 50% CrI and thin line showing 95% CrI. Dots show implied R based on contact tracing data in PHE Technical Report 12.

title: 'The impact of local and national restrictions in response to COVID-19 on social contacts in the England: a longitudinal natural experiment.'

description: We present the analyses of the impact of national and local restrictions on the number of setting-specific contacts that people have prior to and during the restrictions from an ongoing survey (CoMix) which tracks social contact behaviour during the Covid-19 pandemic.

# Background

England’s COVID-19 response transitioned from a national lockdown to localised interventions. In
response to rising cases, these were supplemented by national restrictions on contacts (the Rule of Six), then 10 pm
closing for bars and restaurants, and encouragement to work from home. These were quickly followed by a 3-tier
system applying different restrictions in different localities. As cases continued to rise, a second national lockdown
was declared. We used a national survey to quantify the impact of these restrictions on epidemiologically relevant
contacts.


# Methods
We compared paired measures on setting-specific contacts before and after each restriction started and
tested for differences using paired permutation tests on the mean change in contacts and the proportion of
individuals decreasing their contacts.

# Results

Following the imposition of each measure, individuals tended to report fewer contacts than they had
before. However, the magnitude of the changes was relatively small and variable. For instance, although early
closure of bars and restaurants appeared to have no measurable effect on contacts, the work from home directive
reduced mean daily work contacts by 0.99 (95% confidence interval CI] 0.03–1.94), and the Rule of Six reduced nonwork
and school contacts by a mean of 0.25 (0.01–0.5) per day. Whilst Tier 3 appeared to also reduce non-work and
school contacts, the evidence for an effect of the lesser restrictions (Tiers 1 and 2) was much weaker. There may
also have been some evidence of saturation of effects, with those who were in Tier 1 (least restrictive) reducing
their contacts markedly when they entered lockdown, which was not reflected in similar changes in those who
were already under tighter restrictions (Tiers 2 and 3).

# Conclusions
The imposition of various local and national measures in England during the summer and autumn of
2020 has gradually reduced contacts. However, these changes are smaller than the initial lockdown in March. This
may partly be because many individuals were already starting from a lower number of contacts.

**Fig. 1 a** Number of restrictions by English Lower Tier Local Authority (LTLA) over time. **b** Mean contacts for adults from CoMix over time. **c** Heatmap of number of LTLA areas affected by each restriction over time. Graph **A** shows the geographical distribution of the restriction by LTLA region in England overtime. The number of restrictions represents the maximum number of restrictions applied at any time during a single month. Graph **B** shows the mean number of contacts in all settings with a cap of 200 contacts per person, 2000 bootstrap samples were used to generate 95% uncertainty intervals with sampling done at the participant level to reflect clustering of repeated measures. Graph **C** shows a temporal heatmap of the number of LTLA areas that were affected by each restriction. *Rule of Six and 10 pm rules are included in the first national lockdown as more stringent rules were applied with all restaurants and bars being closed and no meetings allowed with any other households.

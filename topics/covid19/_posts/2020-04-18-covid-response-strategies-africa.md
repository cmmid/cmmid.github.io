*Background*

The health impact of COVID-19 may differ in African settings as compared to countries in Europe or China
due to demographic, epidemiological, environmental and socio-economic factors. We evaluated strategies
to reduce SARS-CoV-2 burden in African countries, so as to support decisions that balance minimising
mortality, protecting health services and safeguarding livelihoods.

*Methods*

We used a Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered mathematical model, stratified by age, to predict
the evolution of COVID-19 epidemics in three countries representing a range of age distributions in Africa
(from oldest to youngest average age: Mauritius, Nigeria and Niger), under various effectiveness
assumptions for combinations of different non-pharmaceutical interventions: self-isolation of symptomatic
people, physical distancing, and ‘shielding’ (physical isolation) of the high-risk population. We adapted
model parameters to better represent uncertainty about what might be expected in African populations, in
particular by shifting the distribution of severity risk towards younger ages and increasing the case-fatality
ratio.

*Results*

We predicted median clinical attack rates over the first 12 months of 17% (Niger) to 39% (Mauritius),
peaking at 2-4 months, if epidemics were unmitigated. Self-isolation while symptomatic had a maximum
impact of about 30% on reducing severe cases, while the impact of physical distancing varied widely
depending on percent contact reduction and R 0 . The effect of shielding high-risk people, e.g. by rehousing
them in physical isolation, was sensitive mainly to residual contact with low-risk people, and to a lesser
extent to contact among shielded individuals. Response strategies incorporating self-isolation of
symptomatic individuals, moderate physical distancing and high uptake of shielding reduced predicted
peak bed demand by 46% to 54% and mortality by 60% to 75%. Lockdowns delayed epidemics by about
3 months. Estimates were sensitive to differences in age-specific social mixing patterns, as published in
the literature.

*Discussion*

In African settings, as elsewhere, current evidence suggests large COVID-19 epidemics are expected.
However, African countries have fewer means to suppress transmission and manage cases. We found
that self-isolation of symptomatic persons and general physical distancing are unlikely to avert very large
epidemics, unless distancing takes the form of stringent lockdown measures. However, both interventions
help to mitigate the epidemic. Shielding of high-risk individuals can reduce health service demand and,
even more markedly, mortality if it features high uptake and low contact of shielded and unshielded people,
with no increase in contact among shielded people. Strategies combining self-isolation, moderate physical
distancing and shielding will probably achieve substantial reductions in mortality in African countries.
Temporary lockdowns, where socioeconomically acceptable, can help gain crucial time for planning and
expanding health service capacity.

**Aim:** To weigh the health benefits of continued routine infant immunisation delivery in Africa against the risk of acquiring coronavirus infections through visiting vaccination services. 

**Methods:** We used previously reported country-specific child mortality impact estimates of childhood immunisation for DTP, HepB, Hib, PCV, RotaC, MCV, MenA, RCV and YFV to approximate the deaths averted by the continuation of vaccination during a 6-month Covid-19 risk period. The excess number of infections due to additional Covid-19 exposure during an immunisation visit assumes that contact reducing interventions flatten the outbreak curve during the Covid-19 risk period, that 60% of the population will have been infected after that period, that children can be infected by either vaccinators or during transport and that upon child infection the whole household would be infected. Country specific household age structure estimates and age dependent infection fatality estimates are then applied to calculate the number of deaths attributable to the vaccine clinic visits. We present benefit-risk ratios for sustaining routine childhood immunisation alongside 95% uncertainty range of a parametric probabilistic sensitivity analysis. 

**Key findings:** For one excess Covid-19 death attributable to an infection acquired during a child vaccination visit, there would be 128 (34 - 1,247) future deaths in children prevented from the time of vaccination to 5 years of age by sustaining the routine childhood vaccination programmes. If only the risk to the vaccinated child is considered, the benefit-risk ratio increases to 52,000 (3,000 - 46,487,000). Measles and pertussis containing vaccines each contribute about one-third of the vaccine preventable mortality in these estimates.

**Limitations:** By approximating the benefit of sustaining routine vaccination during the Covid-19 risk period by the estimated impact of routine vaccination, we make a number of simplifying assumptions: (i) we assume that the potential cohort of unvaccinated children during the Covid-19 risk period would be at similar risk for infection with any of the included vaccine preventable disease as children in a completely unvaccinated cohort would be; (ii) we assume that no catch-up would be administered once the pandemic ends and (iii) we assume that the contact reducing measures in place to flatten the pandemic curve will have limited effect on at least the highly transmissible pathogens, measles and pertussis. Addressing these shortcomings systematically will need a more extensive dynamic modelling framework, however, this is unlikely to qualitatively change our findings.
